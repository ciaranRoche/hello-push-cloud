This is a starter 'hello world' RHMAP MBaaS, demonstrating the UnifiedPush Server APIs.

## Run locally

### Setup MongoDB

In order to run the Welcome server locally you'll need to have [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed and running on your local machine. 

Start MongoDB server with:

```
mongod
```

By default, the Welcome server will try to access MongoDB on port `11211`, if you are running MongoDB on a different port you should set the `FH_MONGODB_CONN_URL` environment variable to the MongoDB connection URL.

### Setup Redis

In order to run the Welcome server locally you'll need to have [Redis](https://redis.io/) installed and running on your local machine.

Start Redis server with:
```
redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf
```

### Start the server

```
grunt serve
```

The server will be availble at `localhost:8001`.

If you wish to run the server on a different port you should set the `FH_PORT`
environment variable to the port you want the server to run on.

npm test
```

* unit tests:

```
npm run unit
```
* acceptance tests:

With [MongoDB](#setup-mongodb) and [Redis](#setup-redis) running

```    
npm run accept
```
